## Overview

This is a mock e-commerce site developed using React and CSS. It serves as a single-page application demonstrating the use of state management, React Router and interaction with a simulated data source. The site provides a user-friendly interface with a Home page, a Shop page which displays a list of available products and a Cart page with items added to the cart. The site is responsive and designed to work on different screen sizes.
